This folder contains some of the work completed during a year long course called "Spatial Analysis"
I took during my first year at the University of Chicago. 

My Spatial Analysis final project code is not in this folder, as I am in the process of working to get a 
paper published that that code did the analysis for. I am happy to share it with individuals upon request.
It involved a significant amount of work with spatial data, and some methods used include Adjusted-Interrupted Time Series regression with a control for Spatial Lag. 

In addition to my work in R for Spatial Analysis, I also gained familiarity with R as part of the
Statistical Models and Methods course I took winter quarter. This is the statistics course that is 
required of all Economics majors at the University of Chicago. I am not an Economics major, but I've 
found that information to provide helpful context as to the material.
